AI Personalized Learning Roadmap Generator
==========================================

A full-stack web application that uses AI to generate a personalized, step-by-step learning roadmap based on your current knowledge and career aspirations.

### About The Project

This project was built to solve a common problem for aspiring developers and professionals: "What should I learn next?" Instead of following a generic guide, this tool provides a tailored learning path, taking into account what you already know, what you want to become, and how much time you can dedicate daily.

The application works by:

1.  Collecting your current skills, career goal, and available study time through a simple web form.
    
2.  Sending this information to a Python Flask backend.
    
3.  The backend then queries the Groq API (using the Llama 3 model) to generate a detailed, structured learning plan in JSON format.
    
4.  The frontend receives this plan and dynamically renders it as a beautiful, interactive SVG diagram that you can pan, zoom, download, and print.
    

### ‚ú® Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Personalization:** Creates roadmaps that are unique to each user's input.
    
*   **Interactive SVG Diagram:** Visualizes the learning path with pan and zoom functionality.
    
*   **Downloadable Assets:** Allows you to download the roadmap as a high-quality PNG or SVG file.
    
*   **Print-Friendly:** Easily print the roadmap for offline reference.
    
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
    

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern, full-stack approach:

*   **Frontend:**
    
    *   HTML5
        
    *   CSS3
        
    *   Vanilla JavaScript (for DOM manipulation, API calls, and SVG rendering)
        
*   **Backend:**
    
    *   Python 3
        
    *   Flask (as the web framework)
        
    *   Gunicorn (as the production web server)
        
*   **AI Service:**
    
    *   Groq API (for fast inference with the Llama 3 model)
        
*   **Deployment:**
    
    *   **Frontend:** Deployed on Netlify
        
    *   **Backend:** Deployed on Render
        

### üöÄ Getting Started (Local Setup)

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

#### Prerequisites

You will need Git and Python 3 installed on your machine.

#### 1\. Backend Setup

#### 2\. Frontend Setup

The frontend is a static site, but it needs to be served from a local server to properly communicate with the backend API.

1.  **Update the API URL for Local Development:**
    
    *   Open script.js.
        
    *   const API\_URL = '\[http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate-learning-path\](http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate-learning-path)';
        
2.  **Serve the Frontend:**
    
    *   The easiest way is to use the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code. Right-click the index.html file and choose "Open with Live Server".
        
    *   python -m http.server 8000
        
    *   Then open your browser to http://localhost:8000.
